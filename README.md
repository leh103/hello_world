# hello_world
Just the tutorial repository. I'm just a hobbyist programing now because I am a retired IT professional. I have an Associate Degree in computer programming and a Bachelor Degree in biology. I was a Clinical Laboratory Scientist for 20 years before I became an IT professional. Computer languages I have had classes in and are familiar with include C, C++, Java, VisualBasic, C# and several versions of assembly. I have been following the D language for many years, but have not really done any programming with it other than trying examples in books and online. I am currently following the gtkd tutorial on line.

Anyway this is me.
